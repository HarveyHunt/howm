=====

A lightweight, tiling X11 window manager that mimics vi by offering operators, motions and modes.

=====

Configuration is done through the included config.h file. Each option is described in detail.

Keys, operators, colours, motions and more are defined in this file.

It has a layout that will be recognisable to anyone that has used similarly small WMs.
