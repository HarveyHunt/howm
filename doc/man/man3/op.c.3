.SS "static void change_gaps (const unsigned inttype, intcnt, intsize)\fC [static]\fP"

.PP
Does the heavy lifting of changing the gaps of clients\&. 
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fItype\fP Whether to perform the operation on a client or workspace\&. 
.br
\fIcnt\fP The amount of times to perform the operation\&. 
.br
\fIsize\fP The amount of pixels to change the gap size by\&. This is configured through conf\&.op_gap_size\&. 
.RE
.PP

.SS "void op_cut (const unsigned inttype, intcnt)"

.PP
Cut one or more clients and add them onto howm's delete register stack (if there is space)\&. A segment of howm's internal client list is taken and placed onto the delete register stack\&. All clients from the list segment must be unmapped and the remaining clients must be refocused\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fItype\fP Whether to cut an entire workspace or client\&. 
.br
\fIcnt\fP The amount of clients or workspaces to cut\&. 
.RE
.PP

.SS "void op_focus_down (const unsigned inttype, intcnt)"

.PP
Operator function to move the current focus down\&. 
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fItype\fP Whether to focus on clients or workspaces\&. 
.br
\fIcnt\fP The number of times to move focus\&. 
.RE
.PP

.SS "void op_focus_up (const unsigned inttype, intcnt)"

.PP
Operator function to move the current focus up\&. 
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fItype\fP Whether to focus on clients or workspaces\&. 
.br
\fIcnt\fP The number of times to move focus\&. 
.RE
.PP

.SS "void op_grow_gaps (const unsigned inttype, intcnt)"

.PP
An operator to grow the gaps of either workspaces or clients by conf\&.op_gap_size\&. When the type is workspace, the gap size for that workspace is also changed\&. This means that new windows will be spawned in with the modified gap size\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fItype\fP Whether the operation should be performed on a client or workspace\&. 
.br
\fIcnt\fP The amount of clients or workspaces to perform the operation on\&. 
.RE
.PP

.SS "void op_kill (const unsigned inttype, intcnt)"

.PP
An operator that kills an arbitrary amount of clients or workspaces\&. 
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fItype\fP Whether to kill workspaces or clients\&. 
.br
\fIcnt\fP How many workspaces or clients to kill\&. 
.RE
.PP

.SS "void op_move_down (const unsigned inttype, intcnt)"

.PP
Move client/s down\&. 
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fItype\fP We don't support moving workspaces, so this should only be client\&. 
.br
\fIcnt\fP How many clients to move\&. 
.RE
.PP

.SS "void op_move_up (const unsigned inttype, intcnt)"

.PP
Move client/s up\&. 
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fItype\fP We don't support moving workspaces, so this should only be client\&. 
.br
\fIcnt\fP How many clients to move\&. 
.RE
.PP

.SS "void op_shrink_gaps (const unsigned inttype, intcnt)"

.PP
An operator to shrink the gaps of either workspaces or clients by conf\&.op_gap_size\&. When the type is workspace, the gap size for that workspace is also changed\&. This means that new windows will be spawned in with the modified gap size\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fItype\fP Whether the operation should be performed on a client or workspace\&.
